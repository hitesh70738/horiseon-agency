# Marketing Horiseon Agency

## Task

I had to optimize horiseon's website for search engines.  

## Approach

I first started with adding semantic HTML tags. Below will show the changes I made with HTML tags to meet this criteria:
***
1. line 11 changed div to header as this seciton of the code relates to the heder of the website.
2. line 13: changing div to mav as this makes it clear to understand that nav relates to the navigation bar. 
3. line 27 changing div to section as here there is just and image of a group of people haviong a meeting. I change the class name so its more descriptive and easier to understand what it relates to. 
4. line 28 changing div to main here as this section of the webistes contains the important content of the webiste. In this section of code I have changed certain tags. Rather than having div for images, I have changed it to figure as this is a more accurate description of the tag. In line 29 i have added the id "search-engine-optimization". This is because when you click on the serach engine optimization on the navigation bar it takes you the specific location on the webistes it relates to. I also added the id to line 124 in the css file.
5. line 51 div changed to asside as this seciton refers to the section that is on the right hand side of the website. 
6. Lastly, line 74 div changed to footer as this correalates the bottom of the webiste hence the name footer. It refers to the ending of the webite
